# GL-Nomad
"The Nomad" is a 2D hack-and-slash fighting game where you play as a mercenary in a post-apocalypse world known as Bellatum Terrae.

## Current Build
The currently release version of the game is a Demo Alpha Test, so expect lots of bugs. If you do find a bug, please do me a favor and report it, after all, I can only fix bugs that I know about.

## Requirements
### Minimum
__CPU__ | __GPU__ | __RAM__ | __OS__
--------|---------|---------|-------
Intel i5 or better | IGPU is fine | 8 Gb | Windows 10 or Ubuntu

### Recommended
__CPU__ | __GPU__ | __RAM__ | __OS__
--------|---------|---------|-------
Intel i7 or better | NVidia GTX 1050 Ti or better | 16 Gb | Windows 10 or Ubuntu

## The Technical Details
Unless you're interested in programming, this won't really be interesting...

### Graphics APIs
[X] OpenGL: implemented
[ ] Vulkan: coming soon
[ ] D3D11: in the far future
[ ] Metal: unless OSX forces you to use it, probably never

Audio: OpenAL Soft

Everything else that's system specific is either handled by SDL2 or the engine
